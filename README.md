# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive with Google & Kaggle

This repository contains my implementation of the [5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents) 
offered by Google and Kaggle (November 10-14, 2025).

While the official course examples and exercises are provided in Python, **this repository demonstrates implementations 
using Go and the recently released [adk-go](https://github.com/google/adk-go) a Go toolkit for the 
[Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) (ADK).**.

## Course Overview

The AI Agents Intensive is a focused, hands-on program designed for building autonomous AI agent systems that plan, 
call tools, coordinate with other agents, and ship useful outcomes. The course is built by Google's own AI engineers and 
researchers and delivered in partnership with Kaggle's community of learners.

## Learning Outcomes

Participants develop skills to build various agent systems, progressing from basic implementations to sophisticated 
multi-agent architectures. The curriculum covers:

- Agent architectures and design patterns
- Tools integration for agent functionality
- Memory systems and state management
- Evaluation methodologies for agent performance
- Production deployment considerations and practices

## Daily Curriculum

### Day 1: Foundations
**Introduction to Agents & Agentic Architectures**
- What is an agent
- How to frame your problem as an agent task
- How agent systems differ from LLMs

### Day 2: Tools & Orchestration
**Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP**
- Tools and API calls
- Enabling real-world actions using APIs and tools
- Agent orchestration patterns

### Day 3: Memory & Context
**Context Engineering & Memory**
- Implementing short-term memory
- Implementing long-term memory
- Multi-turn conversation flows

### Day 4: Quality & Evaluation
**Quality, Logging & Evaluation**
- Agent evaluation methodologies
- Observability and tracing
- Reliability metrics
- Performance measurement

### Day 5: Production & Scaling
**Prototype to Production**
- Deploying agent systems
- Scaling multi-agent systems
- A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol
- Capstone project introduction

## Course Details

- **Duration**: November 10-14, 2025
- **Format**: Self-paced with live sessions
- **Capstone Deadline**: Sunday, November 30, 2025, at 11:59 PM PT

### Learning Format

The course combines multiple instructional approaches:
- In-depth technical sessions
- Hands-on coding labs (codelabs)
- Live community discussions via Discord
- Expert-led YouTube livestreams

### Capstone Project

The capstone project launches during the livestream on November 14th, 2025. Participants who complete it earn a badge
displayed on their Kaggle profile. The top 10 participants win exclusive Kaggle swag and are highlighted on Kaggle and 
Google's social media platforms.

## This Repository

This repository contains Go implementations of the course exercises and projects, leveraging the Go SDK for ADK. Each 
day's work is organized in its own directory.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.4 or higher
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with LLMs and APIs
- [adk-go](https://github.com/google/adk-go)

## Target Audience

The program is designed for learners at varying skill levels from those just beginning their AI journey to experienced 
practitioners seeking to advance their expertise.
